/*
Testing 1 2 3
NOTES:
I originally intended to add a few more features to this program. However, I am unable to, due to time constraints.
I have fixed all of the bugs that I have found, but due to the size and complexity of this program (WHY DID I
OVER COMPLICATE EVERYTHING??!), there may be some bugs that I have not murdered yet :)
Also, some parts are not very well commented, because I don`t really know how to explain them using words.

	To do

	To make this rotate properly:

	Here is possibility 1:
	rotate around a pivot (the pivot should be centered as much as possible)
	if rotation possible, than rotate
	else, if it is not possible, shift it left/right until it is possible
	if it is still not possible, than rotation is impossible

	OR: keep on doing the above three times (for three rotations)
	if all of them fails, then there is no way to rotate it

	fix glitch where block has 'landed' when in reality it has just hit the side of another block
